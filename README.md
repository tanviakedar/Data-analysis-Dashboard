# UBER TRIP ANALYSIS
## Project Objective
Analyse Uber trip data using Power BI to gain insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip efficiency, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

##Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/tanviakedar/Data-analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Location%20Table.xlsx">Uber Trip Analysis</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/tanviakedar/Data-analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Location%20Table.xlsx">Location Details</a>

## Dashboard 1:Overview Analysis

## KPI'S
1.	Total Bookings – How many trips were booked over a given period?
2.	Total Booking Value – What is the total revenue generated from all bookings?
3.	Average Booking Value – What is the average revenue per booking?
4.	Total Trip Distance – What is the total distance covered by all trips?
5.	Average Trip Distance – How far are customers traveling on average per trip?
6.	Average Trip Time – What is the average duration of trips?

## Expected Outcomes
✔ Identify trends in ride bookings and revenue generation.
✔ Analyse trip efficiency in terms of distance and duration.
✔ Compare booking values and trip patterns across different time periods.
✔ Provide insights to optimize pricing models and improve customer satisfaction

## Dashboard 2: Time Analysis
To understand trip patterns based on time, Uber needs to analyse ride demand and trends across different time intervals. This dashboard will help in optimizing operations, pricing, and driver availability.

## Global Dynamic Measure (Filters All Charts)
A measure selector will be created for:
✔ Total Bookings
✔ Total Booking Value
✔ Total Trip Distance
This dynamic measure will update all visuals based on user selection.

## Dashboard 3:Detail lab
To provide in-depth insights and allow users to explore granular data, a Grid Tab will be created. This tab will enable drill-through functionality, allowing users to access detailed records based on selections made in other dashboards.

## Process Summary

1.Data Import and Cleaning
Imported trip data into Power BI from CSV/Excel or database sources.
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing date/time formats, and categorizing ride types.

2.Data Modeling
Created relationships between tables (e.g., trips, locations, drivers).
Developed calculated columns and DAX measures (e.g., total trips, average trip distance, total earnings).

3.Visualizations
Built key dashboards showing:
Trip distribution by time and date
Heatmaps of popular pick-up/drop-off areas
Revenue and trip trends over time
Service category performance
Driver performance and average ratings (if included)

4.Insights and KPIs
Used slicers and filters to explore user behavior and operational patterns.
Identified peak periods, high-demand locations, and top-performing services.

5.Conclusion and Recommendations
Interpreted visual findings to derive actionable insights for business growth and efficiency.
Suggested improvements in ride distribution, pricing strategies, and driver scheduling.

## Final Conclusion
